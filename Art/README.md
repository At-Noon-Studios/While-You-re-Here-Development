# While-You-re-Here-Development

This folder will contain all art, sound, concepts, models ETC. Any art used in the Unity project should be imported from here.

Reminder for the art people: The file naming convention will be PascalCase, meaning you start each word with a capital. and don't touch the scripts ;)
